# Image Encryption using Chaotic Systems and DNA Encoding

This Python script demonstrates a method for encrypting and decrypting images using chaotic systems, DNA encoding, and cryptographic techniques.

## Features

- **Image Encryption**: Encrypt images using a combination of chaotic systems, DNA encoding, and cryptographic techniques to ensure secure transmission and storage of sensitive visual data.

- **Secure Key Generation**: Generate a secure cryptographic key (digest) based on the pixel values of the input image using the SHA-256 hashing algorithm. This key serves as the foundation for the encryption process, ensuring robust security.

- **Chaotic System Initialization**: Initialize chaotic sequences based on the generated cryptographic key to provide additional randomness for encryption. Chaotic systems introduce unpredictability, making it extremely challenging for adversaries to decrypt the image without the correct key.

- **DNA Encoding**: Convert image data and cryptographic key into DNA-encoded sequences for added security. DNA encoding mimics the structure of genetic code, further enhancing the complexity and resilience of the encryption process.

- **Scrambling and XOR Operations**: Scramble image data using chaotic sequences and perform XOR operations with DNA-encoded sequences to encrypt the image securely. These operations ensure that the encrypted image is highly resistant to unauthorized access and tampering.

- **LSB Hiding**: Employ the Least Significant Bit (LSB) hiding technique to embed additional information within the encrypted image without perceptibly altering its visual appearance. This technique enhances covert communication and confidentiality preservation.
- **Image Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted image to recover the original image using the same cryptographic key and chaotic sequences. The decryption process reverses the encryption steps, allowing authorised users to easily access the original image.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- tkinter (for GUI file selection)
- hashlib
- React, Javascript
- Flask for the backend
- Axios for API calls
- Tailwind for CSS

## Installation

We need to set up a Flask application with a React frontend to run this application. We have used Vite bundler for front end.
### To run the backend:
``` 
    cd backend
    pip install requirements.txt
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    python server.py
```

### To run the frontend:
``` 
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm run dev
```
## Flow of the application

- open the application and move to the Encrypt or Decrypt page.
- Add public and private images and hit the encrypt button. This will send a request to backend, and the encryption process will begin.
- An encrypted hidden image will be visible to you after it is processed and can also be downloaded.
- Download the params and save the encryption key shown after encryption; hiding this will be required during decryption.
- To decrypt the page, pass the encrypted hidden image, key, and params that you downloaded. After processing it on the back end, the decrypted image will be shown to you.
